# SRIMSimulationData
Learning about SRIM and  data analysis

output: mean, standard deviation, FWHM

First, the SRIM program used to simulate the data of hydrogen ions on carbon element and saved the file as "Hydrogen in Carbon.txt"
Then the python program change the indent from spaces to tab as a seperator and also also removed the header as well

After that, it read data in the file in "Energy (eV)"column to create the histogram and in "Lateral-Position Y(A) and Z(A)" to create the scatter plot

Histogram: show the data of frequency to the energy in MeV units

Scatter Plot: show the ions position on y and z-axis
